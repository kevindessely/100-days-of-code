## Log

### R0D0: November 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a new project called PopBy, a travel app.

**Thoughts:**  Using this as an opportunity to do a fully integrated mobile app.
Struggled with `StyleSheet.create`, on certain condition will have to resort to
using `StyleSheet.flatten`. Will have to research more on this.

### R0D1: November 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Checked out on graphql for PopBy!

**Thoughts:**  Apollo 2.0 has changed so much that the tutorial was outdated.
Struggled with the initial setting up, but it's a good learning opportunity
rather than following it blindly. Maybe I can make a tutorial out of it ? /ps ðŸ¤”

### R0D2: November 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on PopBy's main page. Learnt GraphQL tutorial on
mutation and optimistic ui.

**Thoughts:**  GraphQL's root type consist of Query, Mutation and Subscription.
Optimistic UI are awesome! to indicate to the user that changes are still
pending but being posted. flex-basis are extremely useful if you wanted to set
the View sizes based on percentage value and it's responsive for every other
devices.

### R0D3: November 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Checked out React Native's FlatList for PopBy country listing

**Thoughts:**  Was amazed on how simple it's to implement a list now with FlatList as compared to ListView. No more datasource!
