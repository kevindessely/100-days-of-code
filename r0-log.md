The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [November 19, Sunday, 2017].

## Log

### R0D0: November 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a new project called PopBy, a travel app.

**Thoughts:**  Using this as an opportunity to do a fully integrated mobile app.
Struggled with `StyleSheet.create`, on certain condition will have to resort to
using `StyleSheet.flatten`. Will have to research more on this.

**Link to work:** [PopBy](https://github.com/kevindessely/popby)

### R0D1: November 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Checked out on graphql for PopBy!

**Thoughts:**  Apollo 2.0 has changed so much that the tutorial was outdated.
Struggled with the initial setting up, but it's a good learning opportunity
rather than following it blindly. Maybe I can make a tutorial out of it ? /ps ðŸ¤”
