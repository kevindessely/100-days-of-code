## Log

### R0D0: November 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a new project called PopBy, a travel app.

**Thoughts:**  Using this as an opportunity to do a fully integrated mobile app.
Struggled with `StyleSheet.create`, on certain condition will have to resort to
using `StyleSheet.flatten`. Will have to research more on this.
